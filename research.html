							<p style="padding-bottom: 3em;font-family:Raleway">I completed my PhD under the guidence of <a href="https://www.gps.caltech.edu/people/claire-e-bucholz">Professor Claire Bucholz</a> at Caltech and defended my thesis the end of April in 2024. A complete copy of my PhD is available from the <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu">Caltech thesis repository.</a> A breif summary of each chapter is given below: </p>
							<h1 class="major" style="font-size: 1.5em;border-bottom:0.1em;font-family:Raleway" >1. Petrography and geochemistry of Adak Island xenoliths</h1>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/Topic3.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p style = "font-family:Raleway">For the first chapter of my thesis, I document 39 previously undescribed xenoliths from the Mt. Moffett and Mt. Adagdak volcanic centers on Adak Island, Central Aleutians. These xenoliths were collected in the 1970s and graciously loaned to my research group by Sue and Robert Kay from Cornell University. Cumulate xenoliths from both volcanic centers range from primitive olivine pyroxenite to more evolved amphibole gabbro and hornblendite lithologies. My paper reports in-situ measurements of major element mineral chemistry  for olivine, spinel, pyroxene, amphibole, and plagioclase, and trace element mineral chemistry for pyroxene, amphibole, and plagioclase. I used this data to evaluate the P-T-<em>f</em>O<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O conditions under which the cumulates formed, interrogate the nature of their parental melt, and explore the complex magmatic plumbing system beneath Adak Island. Temperature and oxygen fugacity (<em>f</em>O<sub>2</sub>), specifically, were constrained with mineral equilibria thermometry relying on Fe<sup>+2</sup>/ΣFe ratios of spinels. This work was published in JoP in 2024.</p>

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/Topic2.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p style = "font-family:Raleway">Following my initial work with spinel Fe<sup>+2</sup>/ΣFe ratios, I became interested in investigating other ways in which the multivalent nature of Fe could be leveraged to understand changes in magmatic oxidation state. Specifically, the remainder of my thesis aimed to explore how stable Fe isotope ratios (expressed in δ<sup>56</sup>Fe notation, where δ<sup>56</sup>Fe<sub>sample</sub> = 1000 × [(<sup>56</sup>Fe/<sup>54</sup>Fe)<sub>sample</sub>/(<sup>56</sup>Fe/<sup>54</sup>Fe)<sub>standard</sub> – 1]) can be used to study changes in oxygen fugacity. Fe isotope ratios hold particular promise for deciphering the effects of oxygen fugacity and differentiation on arc magmas due to the preferences of important rock-forming minerals (e.g., garnet, olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, magnetite) for heavy vs. light isotopes of Fe. This preference arises from the affinity of isotopically light <sup>54</sup>Fe for the reduced Fe<sup>+2</sup> valence state and the complementary affinity of heavy Fe isotope species (<sup>56</sup>Fe, <sup>57</sup>Fe, and <sup>58</sup>Fe) for the oxidized Fe<sup>+3</sup> valence state in both melts and minerals. </p>
								<p style = "font-family:Raleway">For the second chapter of my thesis, I built upon my previous work and measured Fe isotope ratios of mineral separates (spinel, clinopyroxene, olivine, amphibole, and magnetite) and whole-rock powders for the Adagdak xenoliths. While my data did not reveal evolutionary trends in δ<sup>56</sup>Fe for specific minerals, or the correlations between δ<sup>56</sup>Fe and <em>f</em>O<sub>2</sub> that I had predicted, I did observe dramatic changes in whole-rock δ<sup>56</sup>Fe between the most primitive dunite cumulates and the more evolved amphibole-bearing samples, with the former being isotopically lighter than the latter. Through mass-balance modeling, I showed that convergent margin magmas may experience periods of enrichment as isotopically light phases like olivine are fractionated (represented by the dunite cumulates, for example), followed by isotopic depletion once heavy phases like amphibole and magnetite saturate and begin to control the Fe budget of the system (e.g., amphibole gabbro and hornblende cumulates). These results point to an important crustal control in the isotopic evolution of Adagdak magmas and their crystallization products, with the increases in whole-rock δ<sup>56</sup>Fe observed between lower and mid to upper-crustal lithologies reflecting a shift from fractionation dominated by isotopically light to isotopically heavy cumulate assemblages. This project was presented at the Goldschmidt annual conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2022 and published in GCA in 2024. </p>

							<span class="image left"><img src="images/ResearchTopic1.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p style = "font-family:Raleway">A natural extension to this last project would be a detailed petrographic and geochemical study of a lower to mid-crustal xenolith suite from a thick, continental arc setting, which is the subject of the final chapter of my thesis. Here, I interrogate the petrography, mineral and whole-rock major and trace element chemistry, and Fe isotope systematics of a xenolith suite from the Mercaderes region of the Colombian Andes to explore the evolution and structure of a thickened arc crust. These specific samples were collected and initially documented by my collaborator, Andres Rodriguez-Vargas, in the early 2000s. While early work in the late 1990s initially interpreted the Mercaderes suite as a prograde metamorphic sequence of mid-crustal diorites, the suite was later reinterpreted to represent igneous garnet clinopyroxenite cumulates formed at the base of the Andean crust from primitive arc magmas.</p>
							<p style = "font-family:Raleway">In this last chapter, I measured Fe isotope ratios of whole-rock powders and mineral separates of amphibole, clinopyroxene, and garnet from a selection of Mercaderes xenoliths ranging in lithology from lower-crustal garnet clinopyroxenite to amphibole-rich mid/upper-crustal diorite. Given the prevailing theory that the Mercaderes suite represented a fractional crystallization sequence, I expected to see the same isotopic stratification of the crustal section I observed in the Adagdak suite, except this time with isotopically light garnet clinopyroxenites from the lower-crust and isotopically heavy diorite from the mid/upper-crust. However, I measured surprisingly little variability in Fe isotope ratios across the crustal section, implying a near-constant δ<sup>56</sup>Fe from ~70 to 20 km below the surface. Through Perple_X modeling, I show these data are more consistent with the Mercaderes suite forming through incomplete amphibole dehydration reactions as mid/upper-crustal diorite protoliths are metamorphosed to lower-crustal garnet clinopyroxenites. This paper was published in EPSL in 2024.</p>

							<p style = "font-family:Raleway">I worked on two research projects at Lafayette College with <a href="https://sites.lafayette.edu/carleyt/rumble-student-research/">Professor Tamara Carley</a>. As an EXCEL Research Scholar, I collected, separated, and studied zircons from orphaned ash beds in the Fairbanks region of Central Alaska. For my Senior Honors Thesis, I separated and studied zircons from glacial outwash deposits that sampled the Öræfajökull volcanic system in Southeast Iceland. I also did an NSF-REU at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum (<a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/natural-history-research-experiences/">NHRE</a>) in the summer of 2016 in the Mineral Sciences department. With my research mentors, Dr. Tim McCoy and Dr. Nicole Lunning, I worked on a project for ten weeks where we partially melted chondrites under different oxidation states to explore the formation of the achondrite meteorite samples Graves Nunataks 06128 and 06129. I presented this research at the Council for Undergraduate Research (CUR) REU symposium at the National Science Foundation headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia, and the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in 2017, where my poster received the Dwornik Planetary Geoscience Award for best undergraduate poster.</p>
